            <h2>First Day in Ireland: How was the first day?</h2>
            <p><strong>Arrival Date:</strong> March 16, 2025 | <strong>Destination:</strong> Cork, Ireland</p>

            <p>The first day was exciting. All the nerves I had during the flight, wondering what the city would be like, what the people would be like, how comfortable I would feel... Disappeared the moment I touched Irish soil.</p>

            <h3>First impression?</h3>
            <p>When I got off the plane, the sky was covered by a thick layer of gray clouds. This made the first impression a bit depressing, but, however, the fresh air helped relieve the 3 hours of hot flight we had.</p>

            <h3>On the way to the residence:</h3>
            <p>After picking up our luggage and leaving the airport, there was only one question to ask: How do we get to the residence? Using the Google Maps app, we figured out which bus to take to get there. The bus ride to the residence was surprising, both for the double-decker buses and the houses along the way. Once we reached the residence, all that was left was to enter and see what everything was like.</p>

            <p>Before checking in at the residence, we decided to find something to eat and celebrate that we were all in Ireland. For this, we went to a pizza restaurant called <strong>CRUST PIZZA</strong>, as the prices were similar to those in Spain. To be honest, the pizzas were <strong>AMAZING!</strong>; it was a thin but crispy crust, and you could tell the ingredients were fresh.</p>

            <h3>How was the residence?</h3>
            <p>When we entered the residence, what mattered most was how everything would be, but luckily, everything was quite decent. Normal but clean beds, a fairly spacious room with 2 wardrobes and a shelf. It wasn’t bad for the price.</p>
            <p>After checking that everything was in order, unpacking our things, and organizing the room, we went down to the residence lounge, which is on the first floor. There we met Felipe, a guy from Spain who we had as a contact before arriving at the residence since we knew he was living there. That said, the rest of the afternoon was all about relaxing, getting comfortable, and resting after such a long trip.</p>

            <h3>End of the 1st day:</h3>
            <p>First day completed. We ended up tired from all the travel and nerves. See you in the next post.</p>
