            <h2>My Trip to Ireland: A Professional Experience in Cork</h2>
            <p><strong>Start Date:</strong> March 15, 2025 | <strong>Destination:</strong> Cork, Ireland | <strong>Duration:</strong> 3 months</p>

            <p>In March 2025, I will embark on one of the most exciting experiences of my life. I have decided to travel to Ireland to complete my internship for the <strong>Higher Degree in Multi-Platform Application Development (DAM)</strong>. With its rich history, vibrant culture, and stunning landscapes, Ireland is the perfect place to take the next step in my professional career.</p>

            <h3>Why Ireland?</h3>
            <p>I chose Ireland because of its booming technology sector, home to global companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft. Cork, a growing yet peaceful city, offers an ideal environment to develop my skills in programming and technology. Moreover, being an English-speaking country, it provides an excellent opportunity to improve my language skills and gain international work experience.</p>

            <h3>My Professional Experience in Cork</h3>
            <p>During my stay, I will work at a <strong>technology company</strong> focused on software development to enhance user experiences in public transport. This experience will allow me to face technical challenges and learn new tools and technologies that I had not encountered in my studies in Spain. This dynamic environment will strengthen my skills and broaden my professional horizons.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: A Life-Changing Journey</h3>
            <p>This trip will not only be an opportunity to expand my technical knowledge but also to grow personally. The experience of working in an international environment and collaborating with professionals from diverse backgrounds will be key to my development as a future programmer.</p>

            <p>If you are considering a career shift, whether by working or studying abroad, I strongly encourage you to take the leap!</p>
